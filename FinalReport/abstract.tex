Guitarists use effect pedals to enhance or augment their sound, but trying out new products before purchasing can be difficult due to inefficiencies in the usual methods of auditioning pedals. Subtle difference in sound and feel make fast and easy comparisons valuable. This project was able to reduce the time required to A-B test guitar effects pedals by 65\% while also providing additional configurations for customers to discover new sounds. A universal adaptor compatible with more than 85\% of products typically available in retail locations enables this improvement to be useful in the real world.
