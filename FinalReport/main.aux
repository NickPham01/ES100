Because most manufacturers reuse their enclosures for multiple products, it was possible to plot the number of products available in the same enclosure with the diagonal screw distance for that enclosure. A cumulative ratio of the number of pedals available with this dimension or less was superimposed over these data points. Because supporting arbitrarily small pedals is not difficult with the design (one long slot would do the job), the plot was used to determine the maximum size slots required to meet the compatibility requirement. The final design supports a diagonal distance of about 6.5". The area of the plot less than this dimension was shaded to indicate the pedals supported by the design. Because the edge of this shaded region intersects the cumulative graph above the green horizontal compatibility goal reference line, this indicates that the design meets this requirement.\relax }}{23}}

This particular capture involved switching from a single signal to a summed signal. As can be seen at the far left (to the left of cursor $a$), the signal is a sinusoid with an amplitude around $0dBu$. To the right of cursor $b$ shows the output after the signal switched to the summed signal (now with amplitude $+6dBu$). In between cursors $a$ and $b$ is the relay switching event. When the contact blade is disconnected at time $a$, the output floats back to ground for approximately $350\mu s$. After this, the relay blade begins to connect with the other contact, and the other summed output can begin to be seen. However it takes a full $\Delta t = b - a = 519 \mu s$ before the bouncing appears to stop. In this trial, the $519 \mu s$ was recorded as the switching time.\relax }}{39}}
