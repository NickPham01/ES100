\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.4}{\ignorespaces Percent of pedals available at a typical retail store that are compatible with plate with diagonal distance $d$. Because most manufacturers reuse their enclosures for multiple products, it was possible to plot the number of products available in the same enclosure with the diagonal screw distance for that enclosure. A cumulative ratio of the number of pedals available with this dimension or less was superimposed over these data points. Because supporting arbitrarily small pedals is not difficult with the design (one long slot would do the job), the plot was used to determine the maximum size slots required to meet the compatibility requirement. The final design supports a diagonal distance of about 6.5". The area of the plot less than this dimension was shaded to indicate the pedals supported by the design. Because the edge of this shaded region intersects the cumulative graph above the green horizontal compatibility goal reference line, this indicates that the design meets this requirement.\relax }}{24}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.5}{\ignorespaces Plot of common guitar pedals' dimensions in inches.

The blue diagonal line is a best fit line drawn through the screw holes for one corner of a major grouping of pedals. The angled slot uses this best fit line below the height ceiling, and is horizontal at the ceiling height. See Figure 2.6\hbox {} for a a rendering of the plate with this angled slot.\relax }}{25}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.4}{\ignorespaces Results of the noise floor measurements. The AP's own noise floor was measured to be $-107dBu$. This was used as a reference value for the other measurements, so effectively the bars show the increase in noise floor over the minimum possible value to be measured; lower values indicate better noise performance. The \emph {direct} signal path's noise floor was less than $10dBu$ off of the best measurable value, while the summing amplifier performed significantly worse at just $-72.2dBu$. For all of these measurements, $N=20$ samples were taken.\relax }}{69}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.5}{\ignorespaces Example AP frequency response measurement plots. The x-axis shows the frequencies of the AP's test sinusoid output amplitude, and the y-axis shows the measured amplitude from the device under test. Although the high frequency roll off of the \emph {direct} routing appears at first glance to be steeper than that of the \emph {summed} measurement, the scale of the latter plot is longer, so it actuality they have the same slope. Also note that the flat level of the \emph {summed} test is at $+6dBu$ rather than $0dBu$, which is a result of two $0dBu$ signals being summed. This means that the latter plot also confirms that the summing amplifier works correctly.\relax }}{72}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.7}{\ignorespaces Example oscilloscope trace showing a relay switching event. This particular capture involved switching from a single signal to a summed signal. As can be seen at the far left (to the left of cursor $a$), the signal is a sinusoid with an amplitude around $0dBu$. To the right of cursor $b$ shows the output after the signal switched to the summed signal (now with amplitude $+6dBu$). In between cursors $a$ and $b$ is the relay switching event. When the contact blade is disconnected at time $a$, the output floats back to ground for approximately $350\mu s$. After this, the relay blade begins to connect with the other contact, and the other summed output can begin to be seen. However it takes a full $\Delta t = b - a = 519 \mu s$ before the bouncing appears to stop. In this trial, the $519 \mu s$ was recorded as the switching time.\relax }}{74}
